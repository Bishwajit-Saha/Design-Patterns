This repo is a place to learn some of the commonly used design patterns.

Design Patterns:
1. Creational Design pattern: These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator
    a. Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
    b. Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
    c. Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
    d. Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
    e. Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
    f. Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist

2. Structural design pattern: These design patterns concern class and object composition.
    a. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
    b. Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
    c. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
    d. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
    e. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
    f. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
    g. Private Class - DataRestricts accessor/mutator access
    h. Proxy - An object representing another object

3. Behavioral design pattern: These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
    a. Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
    b. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
    c. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
    d. Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
    e. Mediator Defines simplified communication between classes
    f. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
    g. Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object
    h. Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
    i. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
    j. Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
    k. Template method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
    l. Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
